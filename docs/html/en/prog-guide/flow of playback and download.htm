The start play command of control interface should be called after calling playback and downloading interface,then the nearest video will playback or download by appinted time range.
Also user can call relative interface of finding record file to get the start time and stop time,and appoint the time parameter according to the returned time range,at last the start play command of control interface should be called too.</li>
